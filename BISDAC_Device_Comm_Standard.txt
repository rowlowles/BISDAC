Communication formats:
1.
Following connection, device will send information in key pairs in the following format:
"KEY: Value\n"
and will terminate the initial info section with an empty line.
KEY will be all uppercase characters or underscores (_), but
value may be any ASCII representable string

EX:
'''
DEVICE_ID: Unit-1
HW_REVISION: GRO-2
FW_VERSION: 1.2.0

'''

2.
Commands will be sent in the above format
The device will respond in numerous transactions:
	The first grouping will be debugging information, test
	cases, or prompts for input from the computer terminated
	by an empty line.
	After this, a result of some form will be communicated
	as key pairs in the following format:
	"KEY: Value\n"
	In the same way as above. This block will be terminated by
	an empty line.
	
Individual commands will all respond with different debugging
information and responses, to be determined on an individual
basis.

If the command requires input from the computer, it will send a
line during the debugging block in the following format:
"REQ: Prompt\n" where prompt is some prompt for information (That
may be displayed for the user)

After sending this line, the device will pause, waiting for a one line response from the computer.

EX:
"
